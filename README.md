### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm a **Technical Writer** with a passion for creating clear, concise, and developer-friendly documentation.

I'm also an aspiring **Software Engineer**, actively developing Android applications using Kotlin & Jetpack Compose and exploring Full Stack Web Development with technologies like React and Node.js. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical implementation and user understanding, and I'm always eager to learn and apply new skills.
